Acronyms used in the stylesheet

To save download time (and because I am too lazy to comment the css) I am documenting some of the class names used. This refers specifically to the sidebar, banner and content area classes that draw the border. The acronyms are simple:

c=center
r=right
l=left
t=top
b=bottom

For example: 

	banner_tc means the repetitive image that goes the entire width of the top border of the banner. sidebar_tl refers to the non-repeating image that is positioned at the top left corner of a sidebar. content_rc refers to the repetitive image that runs the entire height of the right content border.
